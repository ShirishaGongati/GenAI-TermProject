# GenAI-TermProject
🧩 Project Description
The project “Automating Software Test Case Creation with Generative AI” aims to streamline the software testing process by leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate test cases from plain-language requirements or user stories. Traditionally, creating detailed and structured test cases is a manual, time-consuming process that requires testers to interpret requirements, define objectives, list preconditions, describe test steps, and specify expected results. This project addresses that challenge by enabling an AI-driven system to perform these steps automatically and consistently.

Using natural language prompts, a tester can describe any functionality — such as “Verify login with valid credentials” or “Check behavior when password is incorrect.” The Generative AI model then interprets the scenario and produces a structured output that includes:

Test Objective – what is being verified.

Preconditions – setup or initial state required before executing the test.

Test Steps – detailed, ordered steps to be performed.

Test Data – input values or configurations used during testing.

Expected Results – the correct system behavior or outcome.

The system can also generate negative test cases, validation checkpoints, and automation-ready JSON outputs suitable for tools like Selenium or PyTest. This bridges the gap between requirement documentation and executable test automation.

The broader goal of the project is to:

Demonstrate the feasibility of using LLMs for structured test-case generation.

Reduce repetitive manual work in software QA.

Improve test coverage consistency and minimize human interpretation errors.

Integrate AI-generated test cases into automated pipelines for continuous testing.
