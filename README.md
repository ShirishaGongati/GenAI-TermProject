# GenAI-TermProject

## Project Description
This project, **Automating Software Test Case Creation with Generative AI**, demonstrates how a GenAI model can take plain English test scenarios (like “login with invalid password”) and generate structured test cases with objective, preconditions, steps, test data, and expected results. This is for Checkpoint 1 of the GenAI App Rapid Prototyping course, where we need to demo manual prompts, show intended inputs/outputs, and state acceptance criteria.
