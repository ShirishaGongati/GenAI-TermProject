## Project Description
This project, **Automating Software Test Case Creation with Generative AI**, demonstrates how a GenAI model can take plain English test scenarios (like “login with invalid password”) and generate structured test cases with objective, preconditions, steps, test data, and expected results. This is for Checkpoint 1 of the GenAI App Rapid Prototyping course, where we need to demo manual prompts, show intended inputs/outputs, and state acceptance criteria.

## Project Summary

This project demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o and Llama3.1, can automatically generate structured manual test cases from natural-language requirements.  

The system is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook with:
- A text box for entering requirements  
- A **Generate Test Cases** button  
- An output area showing the LLM-generated test cases  
- Support for GPT-4o and local Llama3.1 (Ollama)  
- Basic error handling and fallback
